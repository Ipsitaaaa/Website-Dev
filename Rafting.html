            <h1>Historical Significance</h1>
            <span><p>Rishikesh is a city blessed with a rich cultural history, a beautiful mountain range and the serene Ganga river that flows through it.The name of Rishikesh can be broken down into the Sanskrit words of hrishika, meaning "senses" and isha, meaning "lord." Therefore, the name can be translated as “lord of the senses,” referring to the Hindu god, Vishnu.<br>Rishikesh is one of the most ancient pilgrim places. It is an abode of the Gods, a place of worship and penance of the sages and saints. The celestial stream Ganga descends down here from the foot-hills of the Himalayas making it the most pious pilgrim place. The mystical powers of the earth and water, the spiritual effect, the penance of the sages and Gods make Hrishikesh the supreme holy place.<br>The city perfectly blends modern and a bygone era into one place. There are a lot of undiscovered things that you can do by the city and one of them is caping by the Ganga river.Located in the foothills of the Himalayas in northern India, it is known as the "Gateway to the Garhwal Himalayas" and "Yoga Capital of the World".<br>It lies 21 km north of the city Haridwar and 45 km southeast of the state capital Dehradun.Due to the religious significance of this site, non-vegetarian food and alcohol are strictly prohibited in Rishikesh.<br>Legends state that Lord Rama did penance here for killing Ravana, the asura king of Lanka. Lakshmana, Rama's younger brother, crossed the Ganges using two jute ropes at the point where the present Lakshman Jhula (लक्ष्मण झूला) suspension bridge stands today.<br>The Ganga Aarti (also known as Maha Aarthi) is performed at dusk at the Triveni Ghat.This popular Hindu religious ritual involves playing music and providing religious offerings to a fire.<br>The riverside has spiritual and religious significance because it represents the emergence of the Ganges after the confluence of the Bhagirathi and Alaknanda rivers at Devprayag in the Garhwal Himalayas. Saints and yogis have been meditating on the banks of Ganges since antiquity.<br>The Neelkanth Mahadev Temple is one of the most popular religious sites in Rishikesh. Neelkanth is another name for Lord Shiva and hence, this temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva. It is located at a distance of around 7 kilometers from the renowned Swarg Ashram.<br>Popular as the Yoga Capital of the World, Rishikesh lures foreigners travellers like a magnet. Complemented with all types of ashrams that teach meditation and yoga classes, this destination has turned into a go-to destination for spiritual seekers.<br>According to the Puran Kedarkhand Lord Hrishikesh Narayan pleased with the tapasya of the sage Som Sharma granted him the boon and even gave him the darshan of his Maya. In medieval period very few people lived here. Only a few poets and sages resided in the area. The pilgrims visited the place only during the pilgrimage season. It was surrounded by the mango grooves and shrubs of bamboo and Ber.There are signs that there were many temples here during eighth century but were destroyed due to the floods in the Ganga, earthquakes and iconoclasts.</p></span>
