        <h1>Nanda Devi Yatra</h1>
        <span><p>The Nanda Devi Raj Jat Yatra is held in every 12 years. It starts from Nautivillage near Karnaprayag to Homkund,nearRoopkund. It is a pilgrimage dedicated to Goddess Nanda Devi. Many people take part in this from all over the Garhwal and Kumaon region in Uttarakhand. It is said by the locals that once in every twelve years a mountain goat is born with four horns in one of the families in the Garhwal region by the blessing of Goddess Nanda Devi. During this Yatra the goat is also taken and on reaching Homkund, several ceremonies are done worshipping Nanda  Devi. Then, the goat is left there. It is believed that the goat wanders  around the terrain and reaches Kailash.</p></span>
         <h1>Mythology</h1>
         <span><p>According to Hindu Mythology, when Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati were heading towards Kailash after their marriage ceremony, goddess Parvati wanted to drink water. Then, Shiva created a ‘kund’ or lake with the help of his Trishul. When goddess Parvati leaned forward to drink water from the lake, she saw her reflection and was bewitched by it. Hence, the name Roopkund. While,it is believed by the locals that once during the Nanda Devi Yatra,the King of Kanauj had set out for this Yatra with his people. During  this time, his wife Rani Balampa, was pregnant and insisted to join them for this pilgrimage. In the course, the queen had to deliver a baby (which is considered unclean) which infuriated the Goddess. Their entourage disregarding the pious customs enraged the goddess and she showed her wrath in the form of a severe hailstorm. It is said that hailstones or ‘shilas’ fell like meteors all over the place as a punishment for their disregard. After years of research on the skeletons found in Roopkund, it is believed that those hailstones hit the pilgrims at their head leading to sudden death. Though the exact number of death remains a mystery but it is  believed that over the years number of skeletons have perished. The icy cold weather is the only reason that the scientists were able to get skeletons for their research. There are many skeletons in the Roopkund Lake as well which can be seen floating by the tourists during autumn.</p></span>
